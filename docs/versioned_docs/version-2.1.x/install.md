The TypeScript version of RbxNet requires knowledge and usage of [roblox-ts](https://roblox-ts.com).

## Install via Node Package Manager (NPM)
RbxNet is available on NPM. To install it to your roblox-ts project, type the following in command line/terminal

```bash
npm install @rbxts/net
```
Once you have the module installed, you can then use it in code by importing it as such:
```ts
import Net from "@rbxts/net";
```

## Install from GitHub
This is the option to use if you're wanting to use the latest master build of rbx-net. It's recommended though you use the above NPM option.

```bash
npm install github:roblox-aurora/rbx-net
```
Once you have the module installed, you can then use it in code by importing it as such:
```ts
import Net from "@rbxts/net";
```
